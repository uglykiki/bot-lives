Our idea is about to make a kind of cultural critique to what social network is doing to human, create a chatbot on the website with a certain scenario that shows people specific narratives(or scene).
Inspired by the reading "Pretend to Be A bot", we all know search engines like Google are collecting data from the users. In this case, people are made aware of cleaning cookie after they leave, while on instant message platforms, the data collecting is more complicated and hard to delete. For example, chatbots can directly ask your personal preferences,the more popular and convenient chatbots become, the more personal information users are willing to give. In our project, we will discuss the problems of virtual chatting and the power shift between users and chatbots.
